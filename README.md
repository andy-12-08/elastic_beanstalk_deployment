Deployment of python flask web application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk (PaaS).
The application here goes through a CI/CD architecture, in AWS CodePipeline and gets deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. 
This is very fast way of achieving high avialability and low latency of your application.
Elastic Beanstalk would provision the infrastructure (load balancers, Auto scaling groups, EC2 instances, security groups, etc.) based on your specification (or default specifications)
